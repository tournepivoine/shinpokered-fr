# Shin Pok√©mon Red, Blue, Green, Red-JP, & Blue-JP

Version 1.24.5

Future bugfixes here will be eventually migrated to the Shin Pokemon master branch

#Patch Info  
-----------
BPS patches are provided for entry into your preferred emulator, patching tool, or other accessory that supports the BPS format.  
Download and enter a patch which corresponds to the ROM of which you own a lawful copy.  
- **Red patches (shin pokemon red, red_origback, and red-jp) are intended for USA Red.**
  - MD5 Hash: 3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc
- **All other patches (Blues and Greens) are intended for USA Blue.**
  - MD5 Hash: 50927e843568814f7ed45ec4f944bd8b
- The "_origback" patches are alternatives that keep the original back sprites. 


***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Other minor graphical adjustments.

***Updating Your Save File***
Deactivate all special options and NPC toggles in the old save if it's from an earlier patch.  
When loading an old save file with the latest patch, the player is automatically warped to Pallet Town.  
Normally this will be enough to update the save file without doing anything else.  
It's possible you may still have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, save in the outdoor Pallet Town map on the old save.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.  

		
#Compatibility Notes
-----------

- **Certain emulators are known to cause bugs due to inaccuracies in replicating the original hardware**
  - An accurate emulator, preferably a GBC-dedicated emulator, is required in order to avoid unexpected bugs
  - Goomba and Visual Boy Advance in particular are known to be problematic
  - BGB is the supported standard due to its accuracy and debugging tools
- Compatible with original Gameboy hardware (DMG, Super, Pocket, Color, Advance, SP)
- Potentially compatible with Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2 (using original Nintendo hardware)
  - Simpler flash carts (like cheap bootlegs) are recognized, but products with firmware like the EZ Flash JR. will not work.
  - Works with the save file operations (importing pokemon, item management, and box management) of both Stadium 1 and 2.
  - Will play and save in the GB Tower of Stadium 2.
  - Will **not work** with the GB Tower of Stadium 1.
- Might be possible to use a save from vanilla USA red/blue with this rom hack 
  - Save outside in Pallet Town before transferring over
  - Use the Softlock Warp to clear any invisible walls
- New builds are tested and debugged with the BGB 1.5.8 emulator and verified using original hardware
- Link trading with an original retail cartridge appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link trading between the lite and master branches appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link battles are still largely untested, and they are unsupported in the following ways:
  - Link battling between a master branch build and any other non-master branch build
  - Link battling between a lite branch build and any other non-lite branch build
  - Link battling between builds of dissimilar revisions
- A revision control function has been added that will cancel unsupported cable links
- Link functions via 3DS hardware and its Virtual Console emulator are not supported at this time

#Bugfixes
-----------

- Battle engine fixes
  - PP usage is now tracked for both wild and AI trainer pokemon
  - Moves no longer have a default 1/256 chance to miss
  - Fixed freeze that occurs in defense stat scaling (def < 4 glitch)
  - Enemy ai ignores type effectiveness for moves that have zero power
     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
	 - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd
  - New custom function for undoing the stat changes of burn and paralysis
    - undoing paralysis is accurate to within 0 to -3 points
    - undoing burn is accurate to within 0 to -1 point
  - PP-up uses are disregarded when determining to use STRUGGLE if one or more moves are disabled
  - AI will not do actions during Rage or when recharging
  - Fixed wrong crit damage for lvl > 127
  - Made adjustments to critical hit damage
    - Damage factor is now 2*(2*level)/5 + 4 instead of 2*(2*level)/5 + 2 to simplify some algebra
    - If non-crit damage would be >= crit damage, the regular modified stat values are applied instead
  - The player can now select a move even if frozen, and this fixes a PP underflow and link desync glitch
  - Accounted for underflow with switch-out messages
  - Safari Zone engine fixes:
    - The eating/angry message in safari battles will no longer display incorrectly when returning to neutral
	- The eating/angry safari state counter correctly increases by 1-5 turns instead of 0-4 turns
	- Safari battles correctly reset the catch rate when either eating/angry state returns to neutral


- Move fixes
  - Transform-related fixes:
      - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves)
      - Fixing Transformation loops
	    - If Transform copies an opponent's Transform move, 
		- and the the PP of that move is < 6, 
		- it will copy that move's instantaneous PP less 1.
		- This limits the PP of using transform repeatedly between two pokemon
      - Enemy DVs can no longer be manipulated by having it use transform multiple times
	  - Fixed a conflict where transforming while disabled can leave the new moves disabled
	  - Fixed transformed 'mons reseting their moves when learning a level-up move
	  - Fixed a typo so now transformed 'mons retain their original palette
  - disable cannot critically hit nor print effectiveness message
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Fixed Psywave underflow/overflow with levels of 0, 1, and above 170
  - Substitute-related fixes:
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck (also fixes the sleep-trap glitch)
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage move fixes (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc):
    - can no longer critically hit
    - obey type immunities
	- ignore effectiveness text & sfx
	- use 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Non-link enemy mons now have PP, so always run checks for 0 PP during the disable effect
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons and also corrected the statistical outcomes of the counter

  - Clarified the text for the super repel on 2F of the celadon dept store
- Adjustments to multi-attack moves animation and messaging to improve battle flow
  - Multi-attack moves only print the effectiveness message after the last attack
  - 2-attack moves do not print "hit 2 times" because its obvious that they always hit twice
  - Multi-attack moves hide the substitute sprite on the first attack and only restore it after the last attack
  - Twineedle is unaffected by all this due to how it swaps out its effect on the fly to a poison side-effect

  
- Adjustments to moves  
  - Stat-down moves no longer have a 25% miss chance in AI matches
  - Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
  - Switching out of a trapping move ends it immediately and wastes its user's turn (prevents PP underflow glitch)
  - Ghost moves (i.e. just Lick) do 2x against psychic as was always intended
  - Changes to Bide
    - damage accumulation is done after taking a damaging hit instead of during turn execution (less room for glitches)
	- side effect: bide is buffed because multi-hit moves now add damage to bide for each of the 2 to 5 hits
	- changed to Typeless to play nicer with AI routine 3 (it ignores the type chart regardless)
  - Rest's sleep condition increased to 3 turns since attacking on wakeup is now allowed.
  - Acid armor's animation changed so that does not make its user disappear
  - Metronome now classified as a Typeless special damage move to play better with the AI
  - Type immunity prevents trapping moves from taking hold at all
  - Changes to Rage
	- Now only lasts 2 to 3 moves like Bide in order to prevent an infinite loop
	- As a tradeoff, attack boosts from rage are kept when it ends
  - Minor code correction to Twineedle to prevent future errors, but this has no effect on gameplay
  
- Adjustment to stat mods, conditions, and items
  - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
    - The sleep counter's minimum value is increased by +1 to maintain accuracy of sleep moves
  - Badge stat-ups are now only applied in wild pokemon battles to give parity to enemy trainers (only in hard mode)
  - The effect of X-Accuracy is no longer applied to one-hit K.O. moves (it originally made them auto-hit)
  - Using X-Accuracy with a OHKO move now allows it to hit faster opponents
  - Upped the power of safari balls to account for lower ball factor
  - In hard mode, X-stat items have double the effect
  - HP-UP item now preserves your HP ratio
  - Non-link battles in hard mode use the Stadium 1 formulas for critical hit probability
  
- Trainer ai routine #1 (recognition of stats, hp, and conditions) has been modified
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is heavily discouraged against non-sleeping opponents
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is slightly encouraged against a sleeping opponent
  - using a zero-power confusion effect move is heavily discouraged against confused opponents
  - moves that would miss against an active substitute are heavily discouraged
  - stat buff/debuffs are heavily discouraged if it would have no effect due to hitting the buff/debuff stage limit
  - heavily discourage double-using lightscreen, reflect, mist, substitute, focus energy, and leech seed
  - leech seed won't be used against grass pkmn
  - do not use moves that would be blocked by an active mist effect
  - rules for using healing moves:
    - heavily discourage healing if at max hp
	- slightly encourage healing if below 1/3 hp
	- slightly discourage healing if above 1/2 hp
  - heavily discourage using Counter against a non-applicable move
  - heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
  - heavily discourage disable against a pkmn already disabled
  - Substitute discouraged if less that 1/4 hp remains
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Discourages explosion moves in proportion to HP remaining
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks
  - AI layer changes that affect most 0-power moves (with only a few exceptions like heal effects)
    - now has a hard stop on using 0-power moves on consecutive turns with a few effect exceptions
	- heavily discourages 0-power moves if below 1/3 hp
  - Discourage exploding effects if faster than a player in fly/dig state
  - Randomly discourage usage of 2-turn moves when confused/paralyzed
  - 79.68% chance per status move that the AI is blind to a player switching or using an item
    - Prevents situations where AI will always re-status the player after the player switches or heals
	- An AI mon with three status moves will have about a 50% chance of ignoring item-use or switching
  - Discourage using fly/dig if faster than the player who is also picking fly/dig
  - If the player used and item or switched, AI is blind to the player's sleep counter when considering dream eater

- Trainer ai routine #3 (choosing effective moves) has been modified
  - It now heavily discourages moves that would have no effect due to type immunity
  - OHKO moves are heavily discouraged if the ai pkmn is slower than the player pkmn (they would never hit)
  - Static damage moves are randomly preferenced 25% of the time to spice things up
  - Thunder Wave is not used against immune types
  - Poisoning moves discouraged against poison types
  - Added some strategy to handle when the player uses fly/dig
  - Slightly preference regular effectiveness moves if STAB exists (25% chance per move)
  - Slightly discourage a move 25% of the time if it hits neutral with no STAB
    - Wherein a special move is being used on a 'mon with greater attack than special stat
    - Wherein a physical move is being used on a 'mon with greater special than attack stat
  - Slightly discourage a move 25% of the time if it hits neutral with no STAB
  - The enemy is blind to the player type if considering a poisoning effect move and the player just switched
  - 90.625% chance per damaging move that AI is blind to player type after player switches
    - Prevents situations where AI will always pick the ideal move against a switch-in
	- 'Blind' in this case means the AI will act as if the move being considered has neutral effectiveness
	- The AI might still favor a STAB move or a move that works better with its own stats

- Trainer ai routine #4 is no longer unused. It now does rudimentary trainer switching.
  - AI will not switch if its HP is below 25% as it's ususally not worth it 
  - chance to switch based on power of incoming supereffective move
  - 12.5% chance to switch if a move is disabled
  - 12.5% chance to switch if afflicted with leech seed
  - 34% chance to switch if afflicted with toxic poison
  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused
  - on the lowest stat mod, 12.5% chance to switch per lowered stage
  - There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
    -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types
  - AI switch scoring applies an extra penalty for possibly switching a pokemon into a super-effective move
  
- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes
  -brock, surge, sabrina, blaine
  -bruno, agatha

- Trainer ai routine #4 added to the following trainer classes
  -jr trainer M/F, pokemaniac, hiker, cueball, psychic, tamer, black belt, rocket, cooltrainer M/F, gentleman, channeler
  -all rival phases, all gym leaders, elite-4, prof.oak, chief
  
- Trainer switching (ai routine #4)can now toggled ON and OFF
  - While OFF, trainers will not switch intelligently just like in the original retail games.
  - Press SELECT on the option menu to go to the extra menu and toggle this option under "AI SWAPS"
  - Note that Jugglers are unaffected because their official gimmick is that they switch randomly.

- Trainer stat DVs are now randomly generated to a degree (only in hard mode) to be above-average
- Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in hard mode)
  - The stat experience total for a given level 'L' is SIGMA[n=6,L](12n+50)
  - No stat experience is given for level 5 and below.
  - Outside of hard mode, trainer pokemon have 0 stat experience per the vanilla games
- These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so it supports the new DVs and stat exp
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even switching)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch
- Trainers will not use non-healing items if they or the player are at low HP, making them more aggressive

- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats
  - Mewtwo can learn Swift by TM 

- Engine changes just for developers
  - If wGymLeaderNo is set to 9 when loading a battle, then the final battle music will play
  - The trainer move engine has been backported from Yellow version; trainer movesets can now be fully customized
  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
  - Adjusted daycare to allow exp values over $500000
  - Allow up to 8 digits when displaying experience on the status screen
  - Pokemon can now learn more than 1 more per level
  - The 1.5x EXP boost function now has overflow protection
  - EXP Gained can now print up to five digits instead of four
  - The "<LF>" character mapping can be used as a line-feed
  - Added rom hack version tracking for save files
    - It's a single byte in the save file that gets incremented each version
    - If the save byte does not match, the player is automatically warped back to Pallet Town
    - Helps prevent crashes and glitches when updating an older save file
    - You will be given the choice to warp to Pallet Town if the rom hack version does not match
  - The function that shows the dex entry for starter pokemon is now more robust
    - It now works for any pokemon (like if the starters are changed or randomized)
	- It keeps a backup of the pokedex-owned flags instead of erasing them
	- Removed the unused Ivysaur flag
  - Increased the maximum game clock to 32767 hours
  - Female trainer can be activated by compiling with the _FPLAYER tag
  - TMs and HMs now have actual name lists
  - Reduced saving delay to 15 frames
  - Tweaked the fly menu to be more responsive and snappy
  - Added an error trap to _Divide function for divide-by-zero calls
  - Withdrawing or depositing a key item from/to the player's PC will default its quantity to 1
  - Item evolutions having a level requirement is now supported
  - DelayFrame now manualy calls VBlank if it runs while the LCD is disabled
