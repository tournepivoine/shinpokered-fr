# Shin Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, Red-JP, & Blue-JP

Version 1.23.12

Future bugfixes here will be eventually migrated to the Shin Pokemon master branch

#Patch Info  
-----------
BPS patches are provided for entry into your preferred emulator, patching tool, or other accessory that supports the BPS format.  
Download and enter a patch which corresponds to the ROM of which you own a lawful copy.  
- **Red patches (shin pokemon red, red_origback, and red-jp) are intended for USA Red.**
  - MD5 Hash: 3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc
- **All other patches (Blues and Greens) are intended for USA Blue.**
  - MD5 Hash: 50927e843568814f7ed45ec4f944bd8b
- The "_origback" patches are alternatives that keep the original back sprites. 


***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Other minor graphical adjustments.

***Updating Your Save File***
Deactivate all special options and NPC toggles in the old save if it's from an earlier patch.  
When loading an old save file with the latest patch, the player is automatically warped to Pallet Town.  
Normally this will be enough to update the save file without doing anything else.  
It's possible you may still have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, save in the outdoor Pallet Town map on the old save.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.  

		
#Compatibility Notes
-----------

- **Certain emulators are known to cause bugs due to inaccuracies in replicating the original hardware**
  - An accurate emulator, preferably a GBC-dedicated emulator, is required in order to avoid unexpected bugs
  - Goomba and Pizza Boy in particular are known to be problematic
  - BGB is the supported standard due to its accuracy and debugging tools
- Compatible with original Gameboy hardware (DMG, Super, Pocket, Color, Advance, SP)
- Potentially compatible with Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2 (using original Nintendo hardware)
  - Simpler flash carts (like cheap bootlegs) are recognized, but products with firmware like the EZ Flash JR. will not work.
  - Works with the save file operations (importing pokemon, item management, and box management) of both Stadium 1 and 2.
  - Will play and save in the GB Tower of Stadium 2.
  - Will **not work** with the GB Tower of Stadium 1.
- Might be possible to use a save from vanilla USA red/blue with this rom hack 
  - Save outside in Pallet Town before transferring over
  - Use the Softlock Warp to clear any invisible walls
- New builds are tested and debugged with the BGB 1.5.8 emulator and verified using original hardware
- Link trading with an original retail cartridge appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link trading between the lite and master branches appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link battles are still largely untested, and they are unsupported in the following ways:
  - Link battling between a master branch build and any other non-master branch build
  - Link battling between a lite branch build and any other non-lite branch build
  - Link battling between builds of dissimilar revisions
- A revision control function has been added that will cancel unsupported cable links
- Link functions via 3DS hardware and its Virtual Console emulator are not supported at this time

  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore

  - Transform-related fixes:

      - Fixing Transformation loops
	    - If Transform copies an opponent's Transform move,

    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute

     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage move fixes (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc):
    - can no longer critically hit
    - obey type immunities
	- ignore effectiveness text & sfx
	- use 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss

  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Non-link enemy mons now have PP, so always run checks for 0 PP during the disable effect
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons and also corrected the statistical outcomes of the counter

  - Stat-down moves no longer have a 25% miss chance in AI matches
  - Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
  - Switching out of a trapping move ends it immediately and wastes its user's turn (prevents PP underflow glitch)
  - Ghost moves (i.e. just Lick) do 2x against psychic as was always intended
  - Changes to Bide
    - damage accumulation is done after taking a damaging hit instead of during turn execution (less room for glitches)

  - Rest's sleep condition increased to 3 turns since attacking on wakeup is now allowed.

- Adjustment to stat mods, conditions, and items
  - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
    - The sleep counter's minimum value is increased by +1 to maintain accuracy of sleep moves
  - Badge stat-ups are now only applied in wild pokemon battles to give parity to enemy trainers (only in hard mode)
  - The effect of X-Accuracy is no longer applied to one-hit K.O. moves (it originally made them auto-hit)
  - Using X-Accuracy with a OHKO move now allows it to hit faster opponents
  - Upped the power of safari balls to account for lower ball factor
  - In hard mode, X-stat items have double the effect
  - HP-UP item now preserves your HP ratio
  - Non-link battles in hard mode use the Stadium 1 formulas for critical hit probability
  
- Trainer ai routine #1 (recognition of stats, hp, and conditions) has been modified
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is heavily discouraged against non-sleeping opponents
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is slightly encouraged against a sleeping opponent
  - using a zero-power confusion effect move is heavily discouraged against confused opponents
  - moves that would miss against an active substitute are heavily discouraged
  - stat buff/debuffs are heavily discouraged if it would have no effect due to hitting the buff/debuff stage limit
  - heavily discourage double-using lightscreen, reflect, mist, substitute, focus energy, and leech seed
  - leech seed won't be used against grass pkmn
  - do not use moves that would be blocked by an active mist effect
  - rules for using healing moves:
    - heavily discourage healing if at max hp
	- slightly encourage healing if below 1/3 hp
	- slightly discourage healing if above 1/2 hp
  - heavily discourage using Counter against a non-applicable move
  - heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
  - heavily discourage disable against a pkmn already disabled
  - Substitute discouraged if less that 1/4 hp remains
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Discourages explosion moves in proportion to HP remaining
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks
  - AI layer changes that affect most 0-power moves (with only a few exceptions like heal effects)
    - now has a hard stop on using 0-power moves on consecutive turns with a few effect exceptions
	- heavily discourages 0-power moves if below 1/3 hp
  - Discourage exploding effects if faster than a player in fly/dig state
  - Randomly discourage usage of 2-turn moves when confused/paralyzed
  - 79.68% chance per status move that the AI is blind to a player switching or using an item
    - Prevents situations where AI will always re-status the player after the player switches or heals
	- An AI mon with three status moves will have about a 50% chance of ignoring item-use or switching
  - Discourage using fly/dig if faster than the player who is also picking fly/dig
  - If the player used and item or switched, AI is blind to the player's sleep counter when considering dream eater

- Trainer ai routine #3 (choosing effective moves) has been modified
  - It now heavily discourages moves that would have no effect due to type immunity
  - OHKO moves are heavily discouraged if the ai pkmn is slower than the player pkmn (they would never hit)
  - Static damage moves are randomly preferenced 25% of the time to spice things up
  - Thunder Wave is not used against immune types
  - Poisoning moves discouraged against poison types
  - Added some strategy to handle when the player uses fly/dig

    - Wherein a special move is being used on a 'mon with greater attack than special stat
    - Wherein a physical move is being used on a 'mon with greater special than attack stat
  - Slightly discourage a move 25% of the time if it hits neutral with no STAB
  - The enemy is blind to the player type if considering a poisoning effect move and the player just switched
  - 90.625% chance per damaging move that AI is blind to player type after player switches
    - Prevents situations where AI will always pick the ideal move against a switch-in
	- 'Blind' in this case means the AI will act as if the move being considered has neutral effectiveness
	- The AI might still favor a STAB move or a move that works better with its own stats

- Trainer ai routine #4 is no longer unused. It now does rudimentary trainer switching.
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is below 1/3 HP and player also outspeeds AI
  - chance to switch based on power of incoming supereffective move
  - 12.5% chance to switch if a move is disabled
  - 12.5% chance to switch if afflicted with leech seed
  - 34% chance to switch if afflicted with toxic poison
  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused
  - on the lowest stat mod, 12.5% chance to switch per lowered stage
  - There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
    -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types
  - AI switch scoring applies an extra penalty for possibly switching a pokemon into a super-effective move
  
- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes
  -brock, surge, sabrina, blaine
  -bruno, agatha

- Trainer ai routine #4 added to the following trainer classes

- Trainer stat DVs are now randomly generated to a degree (only in hard mode) to be above-average
- Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in hard mode)
  - The stat experience total for a given level 'L' is SIGMA[n=6,L](12n+50)
  - No stat experience is given for level 5 and below.
  - Outside of hard mode, trainer pokemon have 0 stat experience per the vanilla games
- These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so it supports the new DVs and stat exp
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch

- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats
  - Mewtwo can learn Swift by TM 

- Engine changes just for developers
  - If wGymLeaderNo is set to 9 when loading a battle, then the final battle music will play
  - The trainer move engine has been backported from Yellow version; trainer movesets can now be fully customized
  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
  - Adjusted daycare to allow exp values over $500000
  - Allow up to 8 digits when displaying experience on the status screen
  - Pokemon can now learn more than 1 more per level
  - The 1.5x EXP boost function now has overflow protection
  - EXP Gained can now print up to five digits instead of four
  - The "<LF>" character mapping can be used as a line-feed
  - Added rom hack version tracking for save files
    - It's a single byte in the save file that gets incremented each version
    - If the save byte does not match, the player is automatically warped back to Pallet Town
    - Helps prevent crashes and glitches when updating an older save file
    - You will be given the choice to warp to Pallet Town if the rom hack version does not match
  - The function that shows the dex entry for starter pokemon is now more robust
    - It now works for any pokemon (like if the starters are changed or randomized)
	- It keeps a backup of the pokedex-owned flags instead of erasing them
	- Removed the unused Ivysaur flag
  - Increased the maximum game clock to 32767 hours
  - Female trainer can be activated by compiling with the _FPLAYER tag
  - TMs and HMs now have actual name lists
  - Reduced saving delay to 15 frames
  - Tweaked the fly menu to be more responsive and snappy
  - Added an error trap to _Divide function for divide-by-zero calls
